# Baby monitoring system
Idea behind this project is to develop a baby monitoring system via video and audio. 

1. The system should detect if baby is goingh out of safe boundary and alert the parents.
2. System should track baby activities so that parents can see if baby is more interested in playing with toys or likes to be physically active.
3. To warn baby if she is trying to pull something or misplace things.

In this project i will be trying to address each of these modules independently.
